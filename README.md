# AlphanumsBetterStoneDrops
A mod for Made in Abyss: Binary Star that aims to reduce time spent farming for the flash, electric, incendiary, and explosive stones.

Farming the Stone drops for crafting was always annoying so this mod modifies the layer 2, 3, 4, and 5 normal ore nodes to drop the flash, electric, incendiary, and explosive stones more often. Default values are 30% for special stones, 40% for hard stone, and 30% for sun stones. New values are 60% for special stones, 15% for hard stone, and 25% for sun relics.
